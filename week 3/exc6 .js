5 + "34"
// Prediction: "534", because the + operator is used for addition and concatenation, and when a string is involved, it concatenates.
// Actual: "534"

5 - "4"
// Prediction: 1, because the - operator is used for subtraction, and when a string is involved, it attempts to convert the string to a number.
// Actual: 1

10 % 5
// Prediction: 0, because 10 is evenly divisible by 5, and the % operator gives the remainder.
// Actual: 0

5 % 10
// Prediction: 5, because 5 is not evenly divisible by 10, and the % operator gives the remainder.
// Actual: 5

"Java" + "Script"
// Prediction: "JavaScript", because the + operator is used for string concatenation.
// Actual: "JavaScript"

" " + " "
// Prediction: "  ", because the + operator is used for string concatenation, adding an empty space between two empty spaces.
// Actual: "  "

" " + 0
// Prediction: "0", because the + operator is used for string concatenation, and it converts 0 to a string.
// Actual: "0"

true + true
// Prediction: 2, because in JavaScript, true is internally represented as 1, so 1 + 1 equals 2.
// Actual: 2

true + false
// Prediction: 1, because true is 1 and false is 0, so 1 + 0 equals 1.
// Actual: 1

false + true
// Prediction: 1, because false is 0 and true is 1, so 0 + 1 equals 1.
// Actual: 1

false - true
// Prediction: -1, because false is 0 and true is 1, so 0 - 1 equals -1.
// Actual: -1

!true
// Prediction: false, because the ! operator negates the boolean value, and !true is false.
// Actual: false

3 - 4
// Prediction: -1, because the - operator is used for subtraction.
// Actual: -1

"Bob" - "bill"
// Prediction: NaN, because the - operator is not defined for strings.
// Actual: NaN
